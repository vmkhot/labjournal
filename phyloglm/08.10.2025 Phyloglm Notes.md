Response variable: 1 (oceanic) or 0 (lake)
each feature is a separate model
Checks for the correlation (logistic regression) between the dependent variable and the response
- e.g. ocean v. lake - with - 100_F 

### Correcting for phylogeny
Takes the tree as an input
Sequences that are closer together on the tree are more likely to be correlated.
Correlation is therefore corrected for finding the same feature across the clades
- Correction is done using branch lengths? The closer the species are (smaller branch lengths), the more ancestry they share
- This is input in the form "correlated residuals" - i.e. how independent are the data points?
>    But the residuals are assumed to be correlated according to the **phylogeny**. That is, the covariance among species’ residuals reflects how closely related they are on the tree.
### Results

Estimate: correlation to the response variable. >0 = strong positive with ocean, <0 = strong negative with ocean
SE: standard error
z.value: estimate/standard error
p.value: significance of the correlation
padj: Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction for the p.value (false discovery rate)
alpha: how much phylogeny impacts the feature. alpha -> 0 - strongly impacting. alpha >> 0 - feature is correlated independent of the phylogeny. We look for high alpha
